# react-typescript-multistep-form

A simple multi-step from made using Vite with React and Typescript. This is a follow-along code from a youtube tutorial [Multistep Form Custom Hook With React And TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDCBSnWkuH0)

The purpose of this repo is for me to get hands on experience while learning React and TypeScript. I find that doing a follow-along is a great way to learn and practice.

## Things I've Learned
### React
* Using hooks and useState()
* Clean component structuring
* Wrapping components
* {...data} as props

### TypeScript
* type declaration
* Partial type
* & operator when combining types
* ReactNode type
* ReactElement type
